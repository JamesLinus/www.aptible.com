The Aptible Update Webinar Series is a quarterly presentation that covers recent features and changes to the Enclave deployment platform and Gridiron security management products.

We hosted our third Update Webinar on April 18, 2017. In it, we covered:

- Security and compliance improvements to Enclave, such as Endpoint IP Address Filtering and U2F Security Key Authentication
- More control over Enclave database containers, including self-service reload and (soon) resizing operations
- Improvement to existing Enclave features, such as easier logging setup, automated cleanup of orphaned SSH sessions, and faster/configurable health check timeouts
- An update of the Gridiron AWS private beta

We provided a brief recap of this webinar [on our blog](/blog/recap-aptible-april-2017-quarterly-product-update/).
