Aptible Enclave is a secure deployment platform for applications that handle regulated data. Each Enclave stack is an isolated, private environment where you can deploy highly available, scalable applications and databases.

We manage servers, network topology, security, backups, access controls, and encryption. You get to focus on building great products.

[The Enclave Reference Architecture](/assets/aptible-enclave-reference-architecture.pdf) describes how you can deploy containers securely using Enclave.

[The Enclave Division of Responsibilities](/assets/aptible-enclave-division-of-responsibilities.pdf) describes how Enclave helps development teams meet even the strictest security and compliance requirements.
