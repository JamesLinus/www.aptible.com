The Aptible Update Webinar Series is a quarterly presentation that covers recent features and changes to the Enclave deployment platform and Gridiron security management products.

We hosted our second Update Webinar on January 25. In it, we covered:

- A preview of [Gridiron](https://www.aptible.com/resources/gridiron-compliance-model/), our security management and compliance platform
- Improvements to the Enclave deployment process for reliability, predictability and speed
- Enclave [database logging](https://www.aptible.com/blog/database-logs/) and enhanced [Redis](https://www.aptible.com/blog/redis-ssl/) and [RabbitMQ](https://www.aptible.com/blog/rabbitmq-management/) support
- The [Enclave CLI for Windows](https://www.aptible.com/blog/windows-cli/)
- Continual efforts to strengthen Enclave security
