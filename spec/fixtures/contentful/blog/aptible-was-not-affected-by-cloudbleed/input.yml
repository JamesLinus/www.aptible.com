  If you used Cloudflare in addition to Aptible, you may need to take action.

:body: "__Are Aptible customers affected by Cloudbleed?__\n\nNo, not by virtue of
  using Aptible. Aptible does not use Cloudflare, and as such, our services and customer
  environments were not affected by the Cloudbleed vulnerability disclosed yesterday.
  \n\nThat said, if you use or used Cloudflare, you may be affected. You can read
  Cloudflare’s official description of Cloudbleed [here](https://blog.cloudflare.com/incident-report-on-memory-leak-caused-by-cloudflare-parser-bug/).\n\n\n__If
  I used Cloudflare to cache PHI, what should I do?__\n\nActivate your incident response
  plan and talk to your lawyer immediately, unfortunately. You may be required to
  conduct mitigation, and breach and/or security incident notifications, by HIPAA
  or your business associate contracts.\n\nCloudbleed is one issue. Another issue
  is that if you were using Cloudflare to cache PHI though their CDN without a BAA,
  you may have been in breach of the HIPAA rules before this.\n\nSome have suggested
  that Cloudflare might not be a HIPAA business associate because of an exception
  to the definition of business associate known as the \"conduit\" exception. Cloudflare
  is almost certainly not a conduit. HHS's [recent guidance on cloud computing](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/cloud-computing/index.html)
  takes a very narrow view:\n\n> The conduit exception applies where the only services
  provided to a covered entity or business associate customer are for transmission
  of ePHI that do not involve any storage of the information other than on a temporary
  basis incident to the transmission service.\n\nOCR hasn't clarified what \"temporary\"
  means or whether a CDN would qualify, but again, almost certainly not, as data storage
  is a critical, non-incidental component of CDN functionality.\n\n\n__What if I used
  Cloudflare to cache PII?__\n\nAgain, activate your incident response plan and talk
  to your lawyer. HIPAA is just one of many data privacy regulations. Many states
  require companies to report breaches of personally identifiable information belonging
  to residents of that state.\n\n\n__What if I used Cloudflare for data aside from
  PHI or PII?__\n\nWe encourage you to be safe and rotate all credentials that might
  have passed through Cloudflare from your app, such as session cookies, API keys,
  and user passwords.\n\n\n__What else should I do?__\n\nWe encourage you to rotate
  your passwords for any service that used Cloudflare between September 22, 2016,
  and February 18, 2017. Cloudflare has not released a list of services affected.
  You can find one security researcher’s list of Cloudflare DNS customers (which is
  likely overinclusive) [here](https://github.com/pirate/sites-using-cloudflare/blob/master/README.md)."
