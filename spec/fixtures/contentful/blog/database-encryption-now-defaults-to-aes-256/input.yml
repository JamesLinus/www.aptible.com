  Until recently, Aptible has used AES-192 for disk encryption, but as of last week, Aptible databases (and their backups) now default to AES-256 instead.

  While there is no security concern whatsoever regarding AES-192 as an encryption standard, it has become increasingly common for Aptible customers to have their own partners request 256-bit encryption everywhere from a compliance perspective, which is why we’re making this change.

  If you’re curious to know which encryption algorithm is used for a given database, you can find that information on the Dashboard page for the database in question (along with the disk size and database credentials).
