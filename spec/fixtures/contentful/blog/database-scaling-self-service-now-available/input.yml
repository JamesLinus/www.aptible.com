:body: "We’re proud to announce that you can now resize both the container and disk
  footprints of your Enclave databases from the Dashboard or CLI. For new databases,
  you can also configure the container size from day 1, whereas it previously defaulted
  to 1GB RAM.\n\nUsing this new feature, you can easily scale your database up as
  your traffic grows or when you’re about to run out of disk space. To that end, check
  out [Container Metrics][0], which provides a real time view into your databases’
  RAM and disk usage. Aptible Support will also notify you if your disk usage reaches
  90%.\n\n## How does database scaling work?\n\nThere are two ways you can resize
  your database.\n\nFirst, you can do so via the Dashboard. Just click _modify_ next
  to the container or disk size, and proceed.\n\n![Database scaling via the Enclave
  dashboard (also available via CLI).](//images.contentful.com/8djp5jlzqrnc/6YTpdheUaAiUKmiS2YiCEC/8c5c2f68fa56a52223c6b06fd044590f/heJroWrXMoGCZgKUZmcFcwZvY9kPZ0ak12IS3FIa3-E_.png)\n\nSecond,
  you can do so [via the CLI][2].  For example, to scale a database named \"demo-database\"
  to a 2GB RAM container with 30 GB disk, you’d use:\n\n    aptible db:restart demo-database
  --container-size 2048 --disk-size 30\n\n## And under the hood?\n\nTo provide truly
  elastic database capacity, Enclave relies on AWS EC2 and EBS to support your database
  containers and volumes. As an Enclave end-user, this means two things for you.\n\nFirst,
  it means resizing your _database container_ may take a little while (on the order
  of 30 minutes) if we need to provision new EC2 capacity to support it. This will
  often be the case if you’re scaling to a 4GB or 7GB container, less so if you’re
  scaling to 512MB, 1GB, or 2GB.\n\nHowever, the good news is that Enclave automatically
  minimizes downtime when resizing a database, so even if the resize operation takes
  30 minutes to complete because new capacity was required, your database will only
  be unavailable for a few short minutes.\n\nSecond, is means [resizing your][3] [_database
  disk_][3] [is consistently fast][3]. Even for very large disks, you can expect a
  disk resize to complete within minutes.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments,
  please let us know at [support@aptible.com][4]. Thanks!\n\n  [0]: https://www.aptible.com/blog/introducing-container-metrics/\n
