:body: "We’re happy to announce that Enclave now leverages AWS \"Elastic Volumes\"
  to resize database storage. This feature was <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ebs-update-new-elastic-volumes-change-everything/\"
  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">released a little over a month ago by AWS</a>,
  and lets us grow EBS volumes without the need to snapshot.\n\nFor Enclave users,
  this means resizing your database volume is faster than it’s ever been: it now takes
  just minutes on average, and scales very well to larger volumes.\n\nFor comparison,
  before the introduction of Elastic Volumes, the only way to resize an EBS volume
  on AWS was to snapshot the volume then recreate it. However, this approach scaled
  poorly as you stored more data: creating a snapshot might take a few minutes for
  small volumes, but several hours for active, large 1TB+ volumes!\n\nNow, with Elastic
  Volume support, resizing always results in less downtime, even if you end up scaling
  faster than you anticipated.\n\nIf you need to resize your database volume, [contact
  Aptible Support][1] and we’ll coordinate a time with you to perform the resize.
  Our operations team may also reach out to you to do so if our monitoring indicates
  that you’re about to run out disk space. We plan to release self-serve resizing
  sometime down the road, as well.\n\nAs usual, [let us know if you have any questions
  or feedback][1]!\n\n  [1]: http://contact.aptible.com    "
