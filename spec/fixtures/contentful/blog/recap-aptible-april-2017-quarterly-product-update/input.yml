:excerpt: Quick recap of Aptible's April quarterly product update and all that's new
  with Enclave and Gridiron.
:posted: '2017-04-19T10:30:00-04:00'
:body: "Over the last quarter, we released a number of new features and updates for
  the **Enclave** deployment platform. We also began helping customers deployed on
  AWS to manage their organization’s security and compliance using **Gridiron**.\n\nYesterday,
  on a brief webinar, our team reviewed the updates to the Enclave platform and showed
  how Gridiron helps software developers build and maintain strong security management
  programs.\n\nIn case you missed it, you can download the slide deck and get the
  transcript in [our resources section](https://www.aptible.com/resources/update-webinar-april-2017/),
  or watch the full event below. We also provide a quick recap in this blog post.\n\n\n<iframe

  to be the best platform for developers to deploy regulated and sensitive software
  products. This quarter, we focused on improving Enclave in three ways: **security
  and compliance**, **database self-service**, and **general usability improvements.**\n\n####
  Security and Compliance\n\nWe launched new ways to secure apps and meet compliance
  goals while improving the security of Enclave itself.\n\nWe’ve previously detailed
  these improvements on our blog. Here’s the list:\n\n  * [IP Filtering][0]\n\n  *
  [Managed HTTPS for Internal Endpoints][1]\n\n  * [Customizable HTTPS Protocols for
  ALB Endpoints][2]\n\n  * [Default AES-256 Database Disk Encryption][3]\n\n  * [U2F
  Authentication][4]\n\n#### Database Self-Service\n\nSelf-serve database scaling
  is coming soon. The [Aptible CLI][5] now supports `aptible db:reload`, [disk resizes
  are a lot faster][6], and we will launch self-service database scaling soon.\n\n####
  Usability Improvements\n\nWe launched a few small improvements that should make
  developers’ lives easier when deploying with Enclave:\n\n  * We now protect against
  runaway SSH sessions when your session gets disconnected\n\n  * Memory management
  restarts apps in pristine containers when they exceed memory limits\n\n  * Enclave
  Log Drains [now integrate with Sumo Logic and Logentries][7] as an alternative to
  rolling your own ELK stacks\n\n### Gridiron\n\nGridiron is our suite of tools that
  helps developers build and maintain strong security management programs. Gridiron
  makes the administrative side of protecting data easy and helps to prepare you for
  regulatory audits as well as customer security reviews.\n\nIn the webinar, we gave
  a short talk-through of how Gridiron approaches security management. This starts
  with the **Gridiron Data Model**: an API that integrates data from your business,
  our experience working with hundreds of customers in securing sensitive data, and
  industry-wide security standards provided through NIST Guidance, vulnerability and
  attack databases and shared intel.\n\n![The Gridiron Data Model integrates information
  about your business, everything Aptible has learned about protecting sensitive data
  across hundreds of customers, and industry-wide security best practices.](//images.contentful.com/8djp5jlzqrnc/2RtvTrzrEc24Yycu8Oq4Cm/748ac8804b908de03afc3215b0e0edce/Gridiron_Data_Model.png)\n\nGridiron
  ingests data about your business through a series of straightforward and relevant
  questions that are easy to answer but have important implications for your internal
  security program.\n\n![Gridiron asks simple, straightforward questions that have
  important ramifications for your security program.](//images.contentful.com/8djp5jlzqrnc/S6J2nhUA00cU2saq0oOSm/cc8bbb421c14393862a1291ef10a753f/Security_Control_Questions.png)\n\nGridiron
  uses that data to create deliverables that help you show security and compliance
  as well as improve your business operations.\n\n![Gridiron provides complete documentation
  and reporting to help you show security and compliance.](//images.contentful.com/8djp5jlzqrnc/51R9sqIF6oqI0QEWkEUQK8/de0caefc0d5cbef57a0828d85dff2f26/HIPAA_Documentation.png)\n\n####

  and compliance and simplify the process for working through customer security reviews
  and regulatory audits, please [get in touch][11]. For a limited time we’re offering
